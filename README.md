# Digital-Wardrobe
<p>This is a graphical digital wardrobe created with Tkinter.<br>
It is possible to select outfits based on the clothes I actually do own in real life.<br>
The program will only mount matching outfits.<br>
This was meant as a tool to help me when I did not know what to wear.<br>
All fotos were taken and edited by me, as well as all the code was written by myself.</p>
